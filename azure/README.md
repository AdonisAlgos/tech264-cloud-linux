## The basics of Azure

Microsoft Azure is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offering a wide range of services, including compute, analytics, storage, and networking. It enables organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers worldwide.

## Azure regions and availability zones.

**Azure Regions:** These are distinct geographic locations that house multiple data centers. Each region is a separate geographic area that ensures data residency and compliance boundaries. For example, regions include "East US," "West Europe," and "Southeast Asia."

**Availability Zones:** Within each Azure region, there are multiple availability zones. These are physically separate locations within a region, each with independent data center, power, cooling, and networking. The purpose is to provide high availability and protect applications and data from data center failures.

## How they work together.

**Redundancy and Resilience:** By deploying resources across multiple availability zones within the same region, you can protect your applications from localized failures.

**Low-latency Networking:** Availability zones within a region are connected through high-speed, low-latency networks, ensuring seamless data replication and synchronization.

## How is Azure structured/organized?

* **Subscriptions:** The top-level containers that hold your Azure resources. They are linked to Azure accounts and are used for billing purposes.

* **Resource Groups:** Logical containers within subscriptions that group related resources for an Azure solution. They simplify resource management and access control.

* **Resources:** The individual services you use, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases.

* **Azure DevOps:** A suite of development tools provided by Microsoft to support the entire software development lifecycle. It includes services like Azure Repos (source control), Azure Pipelines (CI/CD), Azure Boards (work tracking), and more.

## Why use the Azure Pricing Calculator?

The Azure Pricing Calculator is a tool that helps you estimate the costs of using Azure services before deployment. By inputting specific configurations and service selections, you can:

* **Budget Accurately:** Forecast expenses to align with financial planning.

* **Compare Costs:** Evaluate different service options and configurations to find cost-effective solutions.

* **Optimize Resources:** Adjust service tiers and quantities to meet performance needs without overspending.

Using the calculator ensures transparency in pricing and helps in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation.

## Azure Cloud Architecture

### Virtual Network (VNet)
A **Virtual Network (VNet)** provides an isolated network where you can securely deploy and manage resources such as virtual machines (VMs). VNets allow for communication between resources in the same network and can be connected to on-premises networks.

### Subnet
A **Subnet** is a range of IP addresses within a Virtual Network (VNet). Subnets allow you to segment your VNet into smaller networks, helping to organize resources and apply security rules more efficiently.

### Resource Group
A **Resource Group** is a container used to organize and manage related cloud resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networks. It allows for easier management, monitoring, and billing of these resources.

### Disk
A **Disk** in cloud environments is virtual storage attached to a Virtual Machine (VM). Disks store operating systems, applications, and data.

### Public IP
A **Public IP** address allows resources like Virtual Machines (VMs) to communicate with the internet. It provides external-facing connectivity to your cloud resources.

### NSG Rule - Allow HTTP
An **NSG (Network Security Group) rule to allow HTTP** traffic permits inbound and/or outbound web traffic, typically used for web applications. This rule allows public HTTP access to resources like web servers.

### NSG Rule - Allow SSH
An **NSG rule to allow SSH** traffic permits inbound connections, enabling remote access to a Virtual Machine (VM) through a Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

### Region
A **Region** refers to a geographical location where cloud resources are deployed. Each region consists of multiple data centers and provides redundancy, lower latency, and compliance with data sovereignty regulations.

### SSH Key
An **SSH Key** is a pair of cryptographic keys (public and private) used for secure authentication when accessing Virtual Machines (VMs). The private key is kept by the user, and the public key is stored in the VM.

### Network Interface Controller (NIC)
A **Network Interface Controller (NIC)** is the virtualized hardware that allows a Virtual Machine (VM) to connect to a network. Each NIC is assigned an IP address and provides communication between the VM and other resources.

### Virtual Machine (VM)
A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a scalable compute resource that runs on virtualized hardware in the cloud. VMs allow users to run applications and workloads without needing to maintain physical servers.

### Network Security Group (NSG)
A **Network Security Group (NSG)** is a set of security rules that control inbound and outbound network traffic to resources in a Virtual Network (VNet), such as Virtual Machines (VMs) and subnets. NSGs help secure cloud environments by allowing or denying traffic based on various criteria.

## Steps to Create an SSH Key Pair on a Local Machine and Put the Public Key on Azure

### Creating a New SSH Key Pair on a Local Machine

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
2. Navigate to home directory `cd ~`
3. Create an ssh directory `mkdir .ssh`
4. Enter the .ssh directory `cd .ssh`
5. Generate an SSH key pair using the following command:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/mykey
    ```

   * `-t rsa`: Specifies the type of key (RSA).
   * `-b 4096`: Sets the key size to 4096 bits.
   * `-f ~/.ssh/mykey`: The file name and path to store the keys.

    This command generates two files:
   * `mykey`: The private key (keep this secure, never share it).
   * `mykey.pub`: The public key (this is shared with the VM).

6. View the public key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/mykey.pub
```

Planning/Creating a VNet

## Why Create a VNet?

A Virtual Network (VNet) provides isolated networking for resources in the cloud. VNets allow you to:

* Segment resources using subnets (private or public).
* Control traffic flow with Network Security Groups (NSGs).
* Enable secure communication between on-premises and cloud resources via VPN or ExpressRoute.
* Protect sensitive workloads by keeping traffic internal.

## Details You Need for Planning a VNet:

### CIDR Block:

* Define the IP address range for the VNet, typically in CIDR notation (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).

### Subnets:

* Divide the VNet into subnets. Each subnet gets its own CIDR block within the VNet’s range.
* Subnets can be classified as public (with external internet access) or private (internal-only).

## Plan to create a VM

* Virtual network + subnet.
* Name.
* Location + pricing.
* Size cpu, memory (RAM) + pricing.
* Storage + pricing.
* OS (concider software compatability) + pricing.
* SSH key pair.
